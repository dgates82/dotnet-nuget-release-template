# dotnet-nuget-release-template

A GitHub template for packing and publishing multi-target .NET NuGet packages via Trusted
Publishing (OIDC), with an optional container-based integration testing pattern.

## What's included

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — build and test on every push/PR (unit tests always run;
  LocalStack-backed integration tests run as part of CI for this template's own example)
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-triggered pack and publish to NuGet.org via
  Trusted Publishing (`NuGet/login@v1`), no API key secrets required
- `src/ExampleLibrary/` — a small, disposable example library (a "notes" library) demonstrating
  both a pure unit-tested component (`NoteValidator`) and an integration-tested component
  (`S3NoteStore`, backed by LocalStack)
- `tests/ExampleLibrary.Tests/` — unit tests (always run) + integration tests (LocalStack,
  clearly marked/tagged)
- `docker-compose.yml` + `docker/seed.sh` — LocalStack setup and seed script used to run the
  example's integration tests as shipped

## How to use this template

1. Click **"Use this template"** at the top of this repo (not Fork) to generate your own
   repo from this one.
2. Search the repo for `TODO(template)` — every placeholder and decision point you need to
   review is marked with it (package metadata, license copyright, `dotnet-version`, and the
   Mono and LocalStack steps in CI). Working through those markers covers most of the
   customization below.
3. Replace `src/ExampleLibrary` (and its test project) with your own library.
4. Configure Trusted Publishing and add the `NUGET_USER` secret — see
   [Trusted Publishing setup](#trusted-publishing-setup) below.
5. Rename `ExampleLibrary` throughout to match your library — the `.csproj` files, `.sln`,
   `PackageId`, root namespace, and the `ExampleLibrary.Tests` project. Update the project
   path references inside the `.sln` accordingly.
6. Push a tag matching `v*` (e.g. `v1.0.0`) to trigger `release.yml` — it packs and publishes
   automatically. The version in the package comes from the tag itself, not from anything
   hardcoded in the `.csproj`.

## Customizing for your project

`ci.yml`/`release.yml` run `dotnet restore`/`build`/`test`/`pack` generically against whatever
`<TargetFrameworks>` your `.csproj` declares — adjust that property to whatever frameworks you
actually target. If you change the framework versions, update `dotnet-version` in both
workflows to match (this repo uses `10.0.x` for `ExampleLibrary`'s `net10.0` target).

**Mono step (`ci.yml`, `release.yml`):** `ExampleLibrary` multi-targets `net48;net10.0` to
demonstrate the pattern, so as shipped, this repo's own CI installs Mono to host the `net48`
test run. If your project doesn't target `net48` (or another pre-.NET-Core framework), remove
the `Setup Mono` step entirely — it's dead weight otherwise.

**LocalStack/Docker block (`ci.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker/seed.sh`):** required for
this template's own CI, since `S3NoteStoreTests` exercises it directly. Once you replace
`ExampleLibrary` with your own project, this becomes entirely optional — keep it if your
package touches an external dependency worth integration-testing, adapt it to a different
service (any Testcontainers-supported image works the same way), or delete it if it doesn't
apply.

## Trusted Publishing setup

1. On [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org), go to your account's **Trusted Publishing**
   settings and add a new trusted publisher, linking it to your GitHub repo, the
   `release.yml` workflow file, and (optionally) an environment name if you use one.
2. In your GitHub repo, add a repository secret named `NUGET_USER` containing your NuGet.org
   profile name — your username, visible in your NuGet.org account settings, not an API key or
   email address.
3. No other secrets are needed. `release.yml`'s `publish` job requests `id-token: write`
   permission and exchanges a short-lived OIDC token for a NuGet API key at publish time via
   `NuGet/login@v1` — nothing long-lived is stored in the repo.

## Repo hygiene (recommended)

This repo protects `main` with a GitHub Ruleset: require a PR before merging, at least 1
approval, a required status check tied to the CI job, and force-pushes blocked (with the repo
owner on the bypass list).

Worth replicating on your generated repo — but add the Ruleset *after* your first CI run, since
the required status check needs an existing check run to attach to.
